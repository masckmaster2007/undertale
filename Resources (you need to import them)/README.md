# Resources
On the code you'll see multiple instances of

```vbnet
My.Resources.fend
My.Resources.dont
My.Resources.cannot
```

So...

* fend is the first WAV song loop
* cannot is the last WAV song loop
* dont is the image on the screen

You'll need to go into the project settings and add those resources...
